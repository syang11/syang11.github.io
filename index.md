# About

I've recently joined the University of Pennsylvania as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics and the Center for Causal Inference. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and biomedical informatics.

Previously, I graduated as a PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.
