# About

I've joined the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, & Informatics, and the AI4AD project. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning/data mining and biomedical informatics.

Previously, I graduated as a PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.
